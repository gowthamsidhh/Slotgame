# Slotgame

This slot machine game is a simple and interactive simulation based on typical casino slot games. Players start the game by depositing an amount of money they wish to play with. The core of the game involves spinning a 3x3 grid of slots, each populated with symbols from a predefined set that includes 'A', 'b', 'C', and 'D'. These symbols have different values associated with them, which influence the game's payouts.

Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of the game's features and mechanics:

Symbol Distribution and Values:

The grid has symbols 'A', 'b', 'C', and 'D' with respective quantities and values influencing their frequency and payout. Symbol 'A' appears most frequently and has the lowest value, while 'D' appears least frequently but has the highest value.
Betting System:

Players can bet on up to 3 lines horizontally across the slot grid. They choose how many lines to bet on and the amount to bet per line. The total bet for a spin is the product of the number of lines and the bet per line.
Spinning Mechanism:

Upon deciding the bet, players can spin the slot machine. The game randomly assigns symbols to the 3x3 grid based on the predefined frequency of each symbol.
Winning Conditions:

Wins are determined by checking if all symbols in a line are the same after a spin. Each line that displays identical symbols across results in a win. The payout for each line win is calculated by multiplying the symbol's value by the line bet.
Game Interface:

Players interact through simple prompts to deposit money, set their bets, and initiate spins. The game displays the current balance, the amount bet, and the results of the spin, including any winnings and winning lines.
End Game Conditions:

Players can continue to spin as long as they have sufficient balance. They can choose to quit the game at any time by entering 'q' when prompted for a spin.
This game is a fun and straightforward example of how slot machines work, encapsulating the thrill of betting and the chance of winning based on the alignment of symbols. It provides an accessible way to understand the dynamics of slot games without the complexity of additional features like wilds, scatters, or bonus rounds.
